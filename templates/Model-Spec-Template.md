## üö´ **ANTI-OVERREACH PROTOCOLS**

### What Components CANNOT Do
**COMPONENT-01**:
- ‚ùå Cannot modify [other component's data]
- ‚ùå Cannot trigger [other component's actions]
- ‚ùå Cannot access [restricted resources]

**COMPONENT-02**:
- ‚ùå Cannot modify [other component's data]
- ‚ùå Cannot trigger [other component's actions]
- ‚ùå Cannot access [restricted resources]

### Context Bleed Prevention
```javascript
// Example: How to prevent components from interfering
if (userAction === "component1_action") {
    scope = COMPONENT_01_ONLY; // Never accesses COMPONENT-02 code
}
```

## üß™ **TEST CASES**

### Success Scenarios
```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]
  Scenario: [Specific use case]
    Given [initial condition]
    When [user action]
    Then [expected outcome]
```

### Failure Scenarios
```gherkin
Scenario: [Error condition]
  Given [problematic input/condition]
  When [user action]
  Then [system should handle gracefully]
```

### Edge Cases
- [ ] [Edge case 1]: [How system handles it]
- [ ] [Edge case 2]: [How system handles it]
- [ ] [Edge case 3]: [How system handles it]
