# Vibe Coding Model System (VCMS) Documentation Standards

**Version**: 2.2.0  
**Created**: July 13, 2025  
**Purpose**: Ensure consistent, organized documentation across all VCMS projects

---

## 📝 **Session Summaries & Change Logs**

### **Why They Matter**
- Session summaries and change logs are the backbone of VCMS project continuity.
- They ensure that every change, improvement, problem, solution, or file/folder move is captured for the next developer—human or AI.
- No session should end without updating these docs. This is non-negotiable for all contributors.

### **What to Document**
- **Session Summary**: What was worked on, key decisions, problems encountered, solutions found, and next steps.
- **Change Log**: Every change made—features added, bugs fixed, refactors, migrations, improvements, and any significant project events.
- **Moves & Migrations**: Any file/folder moves, renames, or structural changes must be logged.
- **Improvements**: Process, workflow, or documentation improvements.
- **Problems & Solutions**: Issues faced and how they were resolved (or if unresolved, what was tried).

### **How to Document**
- Use the provided templates for both session summaries and change logs.
- Write clearly and concisely—enough detail for someone new to pick up where you left off.
- Always include:
  - Date and session focus
  - What was attempted and accomplished
  - Any blockers or unresolved issues
  - Decisions made and rationale
  - Next steps or TODOs

### **Checklist: Before Ending Any Session**
- [ ] Update the session summary with all key activities and learnings
- [ ] Log all changes, moves, and improvements in the change log
- [ ] Document any problems and their solutions (or attempted solutions)
- [ ] Leave clear notes for the next developer (human or AI)
- [ ] Commit and push documentation updates

**Remember:**
> If it’s not documented, it didn’t happen. Every session, every change, every problem—write it down before you stop. This is how VCMS ensures seamless handoff and continuous improvement.

## 🚨 **CRITICAL STRUCTURE NOTES - JULY 2025**

### **Success Metrics Status**
- **CURRENT STATE**: We don't have established success metrics yet
- **ACTION NEEDED**: Remove or reduce overly ambitious success metrics from documentation
- **APPROACH**: Focus on functional delivery and user feedback rather than complex metrics
- **NOTE**: Can include basic metrics (app runs, features work) but avoid enterprise-level KPIs

### **Framework Naming**
- **CORRECT NAME**: "Vibe Coding Model System" (VCMS) - not just "VCMS"
- **USAGE**: Use full name in formal documentation, VCMS abbreviation in technical contexts
- **CONSISTENCY**: Update all documentation to reflect proper naming

### **Project Structure Organization**
- For ongoing project structure and migration notes, see `FUTURE-IMPROVEMENTS.md`.

### **Documentation Philosophy**
- **PRINCIPLE**: Smart, definitive documentation over redundant, abstract documentation
- **APPROACH**: Add, refine, merge, combine, regroup before creating new documentation
- **AVOID**: Too much abstraction and unnecessary documentation layers
- **FOCUS**: Practical, actionable documentation that serves immediate needs
- **PROCESS**: Always evaluate existing documentation before creating new files

### **Local vs GitHub Consistency**
- **REQUIREMENT**: Ensure local documentation matches GitHub format exactly
- **PROCESS**: Regular sync checks between local and remote documentation
- **VALIDATION**: Before any push, verify local structure matches intended GitHub structure
