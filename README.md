# 🧠 Vibe Coding Model Spec

> **The Universal Framework for Human-to-AI Development Communication**

## 🎯 What This Is

A standardized communication protocol that bridges the gap between natural language ideas and technical implementation. Whether you have 0 years or 50 years of coding experience, this framework ensures your ideas get built exactly as you envision them.

## 🚀 The Problem It Solves

- **The Gap**: Someone with minimal coding experience has an amazing idea but struggles to communicate it to LLMs or no-code tools
- **The Result**: Misunderstandings, scope creep, abandoned projects, frustration
- **The Solution**: A universal translator that ensures precise, repeatable, and measurable development
