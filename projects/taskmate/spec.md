## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

### 1.1 Core Concept
TaskMate is an AI co-pilot for mission-driven productivity that transforms conversational intent into actionable accountability systems. The chatbot detects tasks and deadlines in natural conversation and provides intelligent nudges to reduce task drop-off by 70%.

### 1.2 Target Users
- Primary: Individual professionals and students who struggle with task follow-through
- Secondary: Anyone who wants AI-powered accountability without complex setup

### 1.3 Success Criteria
- [ ] Reduce task drop-off by 70% through AI-powered nudges
- [ ] Extract tasks from natural conversation with 95% accuracy
- [ ] Provide timely notifications within 3 hours of deadlines
- [ ] Maintain atomic component isolation (no context bleed)

## 2. TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### 2.1 Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: SQLite (local storage)
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 API for conversation
- **Deployment**: Local development (Phase 1)

### 2.2 Core Features

#### 2.2.1 Chat Interface (CHAT-01)
- Description: Text input/output with message history
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: React components, localStorage
- Atomic Scope: Only renders messages, never modifies chat history

#### 2.2.2 Task Extraction (TASK-02)
- Description: Parse tasks from user messages using 10 specific regex patterns
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: Natural language processing, date parsing
- Atomic Scope: Never modifies chat history, only creates new tasks

#### 2.2.3 Notification Engine (NOTIFY-03)
- Description: Browser notifications 2h before deadline
- Priority: High
- Dependencies: Browser notification API, localStorage
- Atomic Scope: Isolated from UI components, only sends notifications

### 2.3 User Interface
- **Layout**: Single-page chat interface with task sidebar
- **Design**: Modern, minimal, professional
- **Responsive**: Desktop-first (Phase 1)

## 3. IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

### 3.1 Phase 1: Core MVP
- [ ] Set up React + Node.js project structure
- [ ] Implement chat interface (CHAT-01)
- [ ] Build task extraction engine (TASK-02)
- [ ] Create notification system (NOTIFY-03)

### 3.2 Phase 2: Mission System
- [ ] Add mission system (MISSION-04)
- [ ] Goal tracking and checkpoint management

### 3.3 Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Timezone intelligence
- [ ] Natural language time parsing
- [ ] Mood detection

## 4. CONSTRAINTS & LIMITATIONS

### 4.1 Technical Constraints
- No calendar integrations (Phase 1)
- No natural language time parsing for complex dates
- Desktop notifications only (no SMS/email)
- Local storage only (no cloud sync)

### 4.2 Scope Boundaries
- **In Scope**: Chat interface, task extraction, notifications
- **Out of Scope**: Team collaboration, calendar sync, mobile app, analytics, mission system (Phase 1)

## 5. ATOMIC BEHAVIOR RULES

### 5.1 Task Extraction (TASK-02)
```markdown
- WHEN user says: "Need to finish report by Friday"
- THEN:
  1. Create task: "Finish report"
  2. Set deadline: Next Friday 6PM (user's timezone)
  3. DO NOT:
     - Assume report location
     - Modify existing tasks
     - Set random reminders
```

### 5.2 Proactive Nudges (NOTIFY-03)
```markdown
- RULE: Only trigger if ALL true:
  a) User enabled notifications
  b) >72h since last dismiss
  c) Within 3h of deadline
- MESSAGE TEMPLATE:
  "Hey! You mentioned needing to {task} by {time}.
  Need help? (Reply HELP or SNOOZE 1h)"
```

## 6. ANTI-OVERREACH PROTOCOLS

### 6.1 Context Bleed Prevention
```javascript
if ("mission" in user_query) {
    scope = SPEC_MISSION_04; // Never accesses TASK-02 code
}
```

### 6.2 Notification Frequency Caps
```
MAX_NOTIFICATIONS = 3/day
MIN_INTERVAL = 2h
```

## 7. TEST CASES

### 7.1 Success Scenario (TASK-02 + NOTIFY-03)
```gherkin
Feature: Deadline Awareness
  Scenario: User mentions time-bound task
    Given User says: "Client presentation due Thursday 3PM"
    Then System creates task:
      - title: "Client presentation"
      - deadline: Next Thu 15:00
    And 2h before deadline:
      - Notification triggered per NOTIFY-03
```

### 7.2 Failure Scenario
```gherkin
Scenario: Ambiguous task reference
  Given User says: "That thing needs doing soon"
  Then System responds:
    "Please clarify what needs doing and when!"
  And NO task created
```
