## üìã **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

### What are we building?
TaskMate is an AI co-pilot for mission-driven productivity that transforms conversational intent into actionable accountability systems.

### Why are we building it?
Users struggle with task follow-through and need intelligent nudges to reduce task drop-off by 70%. Existing tools require complex setup and don't provide AI-powered accountability.

### Who is it for?
Primary: Individual professionals and students who struggle with task follow-through
Secondary: Anyone who wants AI-powered accountability without complex setup

### How will we know it's successful?
- Reduce task drop-off by 70% through AI-powered nudges
- Extract tasks from natural conversation with 95% accuracy
- Provide timely notifications within 3 hours of deadlines
- Maintain atomic component isolation (no context bleed)

## üéØ **PROBLEM & OPPORTUNITY**

### The Problem
Users spend significant time creating tasks and setting reminders, but often forget to follow through. They need a system that automatically detects tasks in natural conversation and provides intelligent accountability without requiring manual setup or complex integrations.

**Example**: "Users spend 30 minutes every morning trying to figure out what tasks to prioritize, leading to missed deadlines and stress."

### Why This Matters Now
Remote work has increased task complexity, and existing tools don't provide intelligent prioritization or natural conversation integration. Users want AI-powered productivity that works seamlessly with their existing workflow.

**Example**: "Remote work has increased task complexity, and existing tools don't provide intelligent prioritization."

### Market Validation
- [x] User interviews conducted (concept validation)
- [x] Support ticket analysis (task management pain points)
- [x] Competitor research (gap in AI-powered accountability)
- [x] Data analysis (task completion rates)
- [x] Other: VCMS framework validation with multiple LLMs

## üë• **USERS & USE CASES**

### Primary Users
**User Type 1**: Busy Professional
- **Who they are**: Individual professionals juggling multiple projects and deadlines
- **What they need**: Automatic task detection and intelligent reminders
- **Current pain**: Manually creating tasks and setting reminders, forgetting important deadlines

**User Type 2**: Student/Remote Worker
- **Who they are**: Students or remote workers managing their own schedule
- **What they need**: AI-powered accountability without complex setup
- **Current pain**: Lack of structure and accountability in self-directed work

### Key Use Cases
1. **Use Case 1**: User mentions deadline in conversation ‚Üí System creates task and sets reminder
2. **Use Case 2**: User discusses project goals ‚Üí System extracts actionable tasks
3. **Use Case 3**: User receives intelligent nudge before deadline ‚Üí System provides accountability

## üéØ **SOLUTION OVERVIEW**

### Core Features
1. **Chat Interface**: Natural conversation input/output with message history
2. **Task Extraction**: Parse tasks from user messages using specific regex patterns
3. **Notification Engine**: Browser notifications 2h before deadline with intelligent nudges

### What We're NOT Building
- ‚ùå Team collaboration features (Phase 2)
- ‚ùå Calendar integrations (Phase 1)
- ‚ùå Advanced analytics dashboard (not core to MVP)
- ‚ùå Mobile app (web-first, mobile-responsive)
- ‚ùå Mission system (Phase 2)

## üìä **SUCCESS METRICS**

### Primary Metrics
- **Task Drop-off Reduction**: 70% reduction by Week 8
- **Task Extraction Accuracy**: 95% accuracy by Week 4

### Secondary Metrics
- **Notification Response Rate**: 80% user engagement by Week 6
- **User Retention**: 60% weekly active users by Week 8

### How We'll Measure
- Task completion tracking via localStorage
- Notification interaction rates
- User feedback and satisfaction scores
- Weekly usage analytics

---

## üöÄ **LAUNCH PLAN**

### MVP Scope
**Phase 1** (Weeks 1-4): Web app with chat interface, task extraction, and notifications
**Phase 2** (Weeks 5-8): PWA features and mission system
**Phase 3** (Weeks 9-12): Cross-platform native app (optional)

### Go-to-Market Strategy
- **Target audience**: Individual professionals and students
- **Distribution**: Web app accessible via browser, then PWA for mobile
- **Success criteria**: 100 active users with 70% task completion rate

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **RISKS & ASSUMPTIONS**

### Key Assumptions
1. **Assumption 1**: Users will engage with browser notifications ‚Üí **Rationale**: Mobile-first users are accustomed to notifications
2. **Assumption 2**: Natural language task extraction will be accurate enough ‚Üí **Rationale**: Specific regex patterns reduce ambiguity

### Potential Risks
1. **Risk 1**: Browser notification permissions denied ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Graceful fallback to in-app notifications
2. **Risk 2**: Task extraction accuracy below 95% ‚Üí **Mitigation**: Iterative improvement based on user feedback
